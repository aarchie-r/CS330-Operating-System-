In the assignment, four scheduling algorithms are to be implemented (and experimented with):
- `SCHED_NPREEMPT_FCFS`: non-preemptive first come first serve [code 0]
- `SCHED_NPREEMPT_SJF`: non-preemptive shortest job first [code 1]
- `SCHED_PREEMPT_RR`: preemptive round-robin [code 2]
- `SCHED_PREEMPT_UNIX`: preemptive UNIX scheduler [code 3]; the base priority value of a process is used only in this scheduler
